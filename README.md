# Two-Factor Authenthication (2FA) for e107 

**This plugin is currently in development and should not be used on a production environment or live website yet.**

## Features
This plugin adds Two Factor Authentication (2FA) to an e107 installation. It can be used in combination with any [authentication app](https://github.com/e107inc/twofactorauth/#recommended-authenticator-applications) on your (mobile) device. 

It makes use of the [TwoFactorAuth Library by RobThree](https://github.com/RobThree/TwoFactorAuth).
